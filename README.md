# Semantic Event Detection using Optimized Vision–Language Model

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements **Semantic Event Detection** using an optimized Vision–Language Model.  
The system analyzes input images and identifies high-level semantic events by leveraging multimodal understanding between visual and textual features.

The model combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to detect meaningful events in images efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform semantic event detection from images
- Use a pre-trained Vision–Language model
- Optimize inference performance
- Implement the system in standalone Python
- Demonstrate practical real-world event understanding

---

## 🧠 Model Used
This project uses a pre-trained Vision–Language Model such as:
- CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)
  OR
- BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining)

The model maps images and text into a shared embedding space to determine semantic similarity and detect events.
